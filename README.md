- Optimize promotional strategies to maximize revenue.

## Data Preparation
- **Imported Data**: Imported multiple CSV files (Offers, Customers, Events) into Power BI.
- **Data Modeling**: Utilized **Power Pivot** to link primary and foreign keys between tables.
- **Data Cleaning**: Used **Power Query** for cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
